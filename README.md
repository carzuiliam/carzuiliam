# üëã Hello!

I'm Carlos -- a full-stack developer with a creative soul, a love for clean code, and a mild addiction to coffee and clever UI animations. My journey through tech started over a decade ago, and ever since, I‚Äôve been fascinated by how a few lines of code can turn ideas into tools that people actually use.

My academic background in Computer Science (plus a Master‚Äôs in Digital Image Processing) gave me the theoretical grounding I needed, but what really drives me is curiosity. Whether it's diving into a new Java framework, experimenting with front-end interactions in React, or building a system that just *feels* smooth to use -- I‚Äôm all in.

I believe that great developers never stop learning. Technology evolves fast (sometimes too fast üòÖ), and I love keeping up with it -- not because I have to, but because I genuinely enjoy the challenge. There‚Äôs always a new tool to try, a better way to solve a problem, or a cleaner pattern to refactor that legacy code.

When I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm probably sketching out new project ideas, tinkering with a design system, or planning how to bring more value to users. I‚Äôm a firm believer that good software is not just functional -- it‚Äôs delightful, intuitive, and crafted with care.

So yeah -- I write code, I learn stuff, and I try to make the web (and the world) a little better, one commit at a time üöÄ
